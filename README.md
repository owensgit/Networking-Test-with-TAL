# Networking-Test-with-TAL
A very basic TAL application with basic networking and data binding.

Built using the TV Application Layer (TAL) - http://fmtvp.github.io/

## How it works

1. Uses a horizontal list widget containing buttons
2. Users TAL's [data binding]()http://fmtvp.github.io/tal/widgets/data-binding.html to bind a data source to the list using a formatter
3. Within the data source an HTTP request is made using the [networking]([I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)) API.
